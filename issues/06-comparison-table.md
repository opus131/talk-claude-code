# Add comparison table: Claude Code vs alternatives

## Issue
The presentation explains the evolution but doesn't clearly show how Claude Code compares to current alternatives (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, etc.). Viewers may wonder "why Claude Code specifically?"

## Suggestion
Add a comparison slide after the Claude Code introduction showing:

| Feature | Copilot | Cursor | Claude Code |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Context** | File-level | Codebase | Codebase + Terminal |
| **Autonomy** | Suggestions | Edits | Full tasks |
| **Tools** | None | Limited | Extensible (MCP, Skills) |
| **Integration** | IDE only | IDE only | Terminal-native |
| **Custom workflows** | No | No | Yes (Commands, Agents) |
| **Permissions** | N/A | N/A | Granular control |

Alternative: Use a visual diagram showing the progression:
- Copilot: "Suggests code"
- Cursor/Cody: "Edits code"
- Claude Code: "Completes tasks"

## Impact
Helps viewers understand the differentiation and make informed tool choices. Currently requires inferring differences from feature descriptions.

## Location
Add after Slide 5 (Claude Code - The Pinnacle) or before Slide 6 (Feature Deep Dive)

## Priority
**High** - Clarifies competitive positioning
