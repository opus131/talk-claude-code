# Add real code examples and demonstrations

## Issue
For a presentation about AI coding tools, there are surprisingly no actual code examples or demonstrations. The presentation tells viewers about features but doesn't show them in action.

## Suggestions
Add slides or sections showing:

1. **Before/After code example**: Show actual code written with Copilot vs Claude Code
2. **Live command example**: Show the actual terminal interaction
```bash
$ claude "Add error handling to the API endpoint"
[Shows actual Claude Code output]
```

3. **Real slash command demo**: Show the actual markdown from `.claude/commands/git-commit-staged.md`

4. **MCP integration example**: Show actual API calls or integration code

5. **Real metrics**:
   - "Refactored 50 files in 3 minutes"
   - "Generated 500 lines of test coverage"
   - Before: 2 hours → After: 5 minutes

## Impact
Concrete examples make the value proposition tangible and memorable. Currently, the presentation is abstract without proof points.

## Suggested Location
Add a new slide after Slide 5 (Claude Code capabilities) or integrate examples into each feature slide.

## Priority
**High** - Makes the talk more compelling and credible
